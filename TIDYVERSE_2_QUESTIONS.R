# Tidyverse Assignment 1
# Mutating and Grouping 
### 

# Step 1. Using summarize, group_by and filter, find the max scores for all indices variables for each region in 2018. 
# HINT: the function for finding the maxium value is max(value, na.rm = TRUE))



# Step 2. Now add the minimum score, and find the range for each region (range is max score - min score)
# Hint: You'll have to use summarize and then mutate



# Step 3 (optional, challenge):
# Now look at the average range by variable. Which variable has the highest average range within regions by year?
