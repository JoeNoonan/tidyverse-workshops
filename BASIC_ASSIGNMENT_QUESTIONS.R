### Parctice

#Multiply 24, 2, 5
#Store the result as a named object

#Divide 234 by 8 and store the result as another named object

# Multiply the two objects together 

# Store the two objects you have created into a new third object.


# Make a new sequence. 20 to 120 by intervals of 20


# Optional advanced: Make a function that multiples an input by 100. 
# Use the template from the basic section to start!
