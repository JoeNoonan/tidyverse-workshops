### Parctice

#Multiply 24, 2, 5
#Store the result as a named object
x <- 24*2*5

#Divide 234 by 8 and store the result as another named object
y <- 234/8 

# Multiply the two objects together 
x*y

# Store the two objects you have created into a new third object.

z <- c(x,y)

# Make a new sequence. 20 to 120 by intervals of 20

seq(from = 20, to = 120, by = 10)

# Optional advanced: Make a function that multiples an input by 100. 
# Use the template from the basic section to start!

multiply_100 <- function(n){n*100}

multiply_100(10)
