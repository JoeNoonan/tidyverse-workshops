# Math

3 + 3

# Base R Functions + objects

# The <- symbols store the results of the operation to the right of them as an an object.
# This is called an assign statement
# Tip! Keyboard short cut is alt - 

# Assign the result of 3+5 to X
result <- 3 + 5

result

# R is case senesitive! 

Result

# You can perform operations on objects

result*10

# Combine these numbers into an array. 

numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# You can also combine objects

combined <- c(result,numbers)

# Using functions 

seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2)


# Custom Functions
# the function(x){} is how you start to right a function. X is the input.
# in this case to run the function you do add_pi(x), where x is what ever input you want

add_pi <- function(x){
  x + 3.14
}

add_pi(x =3)
add_pi(x = result)

add_pi(3)
add_pi(result)
